title: Configuring a Windows Service

In Windows environments, it can be useful to run the zrok Agent as a service, allowing it to automatically restart with your system.

Support for running the zrok Agent as a Windows service is handled through a third party utility, `nssm`, which is available here:

Give the `nssm` documentation a quick review, here:

You'll want to install both the `zrok.exe` and `nssm.exe` in a convenient protected location. In this example, we'll put them in `C:\Program Files\zrok`, as `C:\Program Files\zrok\zrok.exe` and `C:\Program Files\zrok\nssm.exe`.
