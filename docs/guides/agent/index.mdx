The zrok Agent centralizes management of your zrok shares and accesses. It provides both web-based and command-line interfaces, and changes how the `zrok share` and `zrok access` commands behave.

## Tutorial

Run the agent in the foreground.

```bash
zrok agent
```

In another terminal, open the console.

```bash
zrok agent console
```

You should see the agent UI in your default web browser.

Start sharing a public share with the agent.

```bash
zrok share public 8080
```

```buttonless title="Output"
token:"zje5x8p0k9pi" frontendEndpoints:"https://zje5x8p0k9pi.share.zrok.io"
```

You will see the new public share in the agent UI and you can access it at the public share URL.

Reserve a private share for the agent to share.

```bash
zrok reserve private 8080 --closed --unique-name "myshare"
```

```buttonless title="Output"
[   1.883]    INFO main.(*reserveCommand).run: your reserved share token is 'myshare'
```

Start sharing the reserved share with the agent.

```bash
zrok share reserved "myshare"
```

```buttonless title="Output"
[   0.001]    INFO main.(*shareReservedCommand).shareAgent: starting
token:"myshare" backendMode:"proxy" shareMode:"private" target:"http://127.0.0.1:8080"
```

You will see the new reserved share in the agent UI and you can access it by running `zrok access "myshare"` on another device where you have enabled the same zrok account, since the share was reserved with closed permission mode.

Check the status of the agent's shares and accesses.

```bash
zrok agent status
```

```buttonless title="Output"
 FRONTEND TOKEN  TOKEN  BIND ADDRESS
0 accesses in agent

 TOKEN         RESERVED  SHARE MODE  BACKEND MODE  TARGET
 myshare       true      private     tcpTunnel     127.0.0.1:8080
1 share in agent
```

### Running the Agent in the background

You can keep the agent running reliably in the background by installing the agent service in Windows or Linux.

- Windows - [set up the Windows system service](/guides/agent/windows-service/index.mdx)
- Linux - [install the Linux package `zrok-agent`](/guides/agent/linux-service.mdx)

## How the Agent Works

### Centralized Management

Without the agent running, each time you execute a `zrok share` or `zrok access` command, a separate process is created to handle that specific share or access.

When the agent is running:

- All shares and accesses are managed by a single agent process
- The agent provides a web UI for monitoring and managing your shares and accesses
- New `zrok share` and `zrok access` commands delegate their operations to the running agent
- You can stop and restart individual shares/accesses without terminating the agent

### Agent Console

The agent provides a web-based console interface that can be accessed with:

```bash
zrok agent console
```

This command opens your default web browser to the agent's UI, where you can:

- View the status of all your active shares and accesses
- Create new shares and accesses using simple UI widgets
- Stop or restart existing shares and accesses
- Monitor traffic and connection statistics
